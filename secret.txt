Probably not. When you open a file for reading you start with a "cursor".

Imagine you had a piece of paper with words on it. When you first look at the paper, you could put your finger on the first word on the page. This is your cursor.

If someone told you to read the page, you’d move the cursor along word by word, line by line, until you got to the end. When the cursor was on the last word, you’d stop.
